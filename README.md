Navbar
  I created a navbar using the flexbox method and made sure all the links had a hover effect and lead to the corresponding section when it's clicked

Hero section
  The hero section includes a background image and text in the middle. I plan to change the font size and style for better presentation

Section 1 - About
  This section has a h2 and p element which has been centred and filled in with placeholder text. Made sure the margin is consistent throughout

Section 2 - Projects
  I wasn't too confident using the grid method to organise the project boxes so I used flexbox again. I plan to add more project cards and use the grid method to create better styles.
  Each project box has a title and a hover effect that zooms the image slightly together with box shadow effects. Media query has been added but needs to be improved when the screen is between 1000 and 946px.

Section 3 - Contact
  This section has four hyperlinks that will soon be linked to the right site. I plan to give this area better styling and padding.
